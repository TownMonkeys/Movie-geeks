# MovieGeeks (ongoing)
A social media app that allows movie geeks to share their experience with one another.

## Aimed functionalities
- Users can post movies. Each post should contain the movie name, picture/pictures/clip/clips (Instagram style), genre, user's rating and review. when a user writes a name, the app should detect the movie and recommend pictures/clips and generate its genre in the posting window. Followers can like, comment, and share the post.
- Users can follow, honor, and chat with one another.
- Users can create rooms for watching a specific movie with a group chat to discuss it.
- Users can get movie recommendations from the app based on their preferences.
- The app should have an updated panel for the new movies, so users can keep track.


## Aimed Quality Standards
